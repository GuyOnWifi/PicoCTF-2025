Decided to dabble in a bit of cybersecurity and capture the flag (CTF) style challenges. For my first-ever CTF competition, I decided to participate in [picoCTF 2025](www.picoctf.org), which ran from March 17-27th.

I was really happy with my result, placing 36th in the high school category! 

I learned a lot of web exploitation, reading assembly and exploiting binaries through format string vulnrebilites or heap overflows, and forensics with system images. I learned many tools like Burp for web exploitation, gdb for debugging, and Ghidra for reverse engineering!

Below are some writeups on how I tackled each challenge!
