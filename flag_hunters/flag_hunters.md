Looking at the source code, we have the flag hidden in a `secret_intro variable`
```py
secret_intro = \
'''Pico warriors rising, puzzles laid bare,
Solving each challenge with precision and flair.
With unity and skill, flags we deliver,
The ether’s ours to conquer, '''\
+ flag + '\n'
```

Our task is to somehow find a way to jump to the secret intro variable.

```py
  while not finished and line_count < MAX_LINES:
    line_count += 1
    for line in song_lines[lip].split(';'):
      if line == '' and song_lines[lip] != '':
        continue
      if line == 'REFRAIN':
        song_lines[refrain_return] = 'RETURN ' + str(lip + 1)
        lip = refrain
      elif re.match(r"CROWD.*", line):
        crowd = input('Crowd: ')
        song_lines[lip] = 'Crowd: ' + crowd
        lip += 1
      elif re.match(r"RETURN [0-9]+", line):
        lip = int(line.split()[1])
      elif line == 'END':
        finished = True
      else:
        print(line, flush=True)
        time.sleep(0.5)
        lip += 1
```

This piece of code looks promising. It parses the keywords and lyrics, and processes them accordingly. It allows user input for the crowd's sing-a-long, which we can probably use to inject some special keywords.

The return command jumps around, so we need a way for it to `RETURN 0;`. I noticed that the commands are being split by `;`, meaning we can inject one to make sure our `RETURN 0;` command properly executes and isn't just being printed.

We'll deliver the payload `; RETURN 0;` to jump to the first line.

Command line wizards, we're starting it right,
Spawning shells in the terminal, hacking all night.
Scripts and searches, grep through the void,
Every keystroke, we're a cypher's envoy.
Brute force the lock or craft that regex,
Flag on the horizon, what challenge is next?

We're flag hunters in the ether, lighting up the grid,
No puzzle too dark, no challenge too hid.
With every exploit we trigger, every byte we decrypt,
We're chasing that victory, and we'll never quit.
Crowd: ;RETURN 0;

Echoes in memory, packets in trace,
Digging through the remnants to uncover with haste.
Hex and headers, carving out clues,
Resurrect the hidden, it's forensics we choose.
Disk dumps and packet dumps, follow the trail,
Buried deep in the noise, but we will prevail.

We're flag hunters in the ether, lighting up the grid,
No puzzle too dark, no challenge too hid.
With every exploit we trigger, every byte we decrypt,
We're chasing that victory, and we鈥檒l never quit.
Crowd: 

Solving each challenge with precision and flair.
With unity and skill, flags we deliver,
The ether's ours to conquer, picoCTF{70637h3r_f0r3v3r}
