The code gives us the N & e values of RSA. I didn't know much about RSA algorithm, but looking at the code gave me some hints.

```py
from setup import get_primes

e = 65537

def gen_key(k):
    """
    Generates RSA key with k bits
    """
    p,q = get_primes(k//2)
    N = p*q
    d = inverse(e, (p-1)*(q-1))

    return ((N,e), d)
```

N was the product of two prime factors, p and q, and the private key was generated by finding the inverse(e, (p-1)*(q-1)). After some basic research, I learnt that RSA relied on the fact that p and q are really large primes, so out of pure desperation, I tried an online prime factoring tool. It turns outâ€Šp was just 2, and q was easy to find. I ran the code, now knowing p and q, and was able to calculate the private key. Using this [online RSA cipher calculator](https://www.dcode.fr/rsa-cipher), I was easily able to decrypt it.
